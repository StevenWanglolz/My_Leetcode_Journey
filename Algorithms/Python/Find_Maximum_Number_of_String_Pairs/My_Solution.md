# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Create a sublist starting with index + 1 to check if there is a reverse pair in the rest of the list.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
1. **reverse Function:**
   - The `reverse` function has a time comp lexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`, because slicing and reversing a string take linear time.

2. **maximumNumberOfStringPairs Function:**
   - The outer loop runs for each word in the `words` list, contributing O(len(words)) to the time complexity.
   - For each word, the code creates a new list `l` with a slice of the remaining words (`words[i+1:]`), which takes O(len(words) - i) time in the worst case.
   - Inside the loop, the `reverse` function is called, contributing O(len(words[i])) time for each iteration.
   - The `in` operator in the line `if reverse in l:` has a time complexity of O(len(l)).

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - The overall time complexity is determined by the nested loops and the operations within them. The worst-case time complexity would be O(len(words)^2) due to the combination of nested loops and slicing.

To improve the efficiency, consider using a set to check for the presence of reversed strings, which would reduce the time complexity for this task. The current approach has room for optimization, especially for larger input sizes.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
1. **reverse Function:**
   - The `reverse` function creates a new string (`reverse`) with a length equal to the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, its space complexity is O(len(s)).

2. **maximumNumberOfStringPairs Function:**
   - The space complexity of the function is dominated by the list `l` and the `reverse` variable.
   - In each iteration of the loop, the `l` list is reassigned with a slice of the remaining words (`words[i+1:]`). In the worst case, this list can have a length of len(words) - i. Therefore, the space complexity of this part is O(len(words)).
   - The `reverse` variable stores the reversed string, and its space complexity is O(len(words[i])).

3. **Overall Space Complexity:**
   - The overall space complexity is determined by the variables used within the function.
   - The dominant factor is the list `l`, which contributes O(len(words)) space complexity.
   - The space complexity of other variables is not cumulative since they are temporary and get overwritten in each iteration.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(len(words)), where len(words) is the length of the input list.

# Code

```Python []
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, s: str) -> str:
        reverse = s[::-1]
        return reverse

    def maximumNumberOfStringPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        l = []
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(words)):
            l = words[i+1:]
            reverse = self.reverse(words[i])
            if reverse in l:
                count += 1
        return count

```
