```python
class Codec:
```
- This line defines a class named `Codec`. This class will be used to handle encoding (shortening) and decoding (expanding) of URLs.

```python
    codeDB, urlDB = defaultdict(), defaultdict()
```
- Here, two dictionaries (`codeDB` and `urlDB`) are created as class attributes using `defaultdict()`. `codeDB` will store mappings from short codes to long URLs, and `urlDB` will store mappings from long URLs to short codes.

```python
    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
```
- This line creates a string `chars` that contains all ASCII letters (both lowercase and uppercase) and digits. This will be used to generate random short codes.

```python
    def getCode(self) -> str:
```
- This line defines a method named `getCode` within the `Codec` class. It takes no arguments (`self` refers to the instance of the class) and returns a string.

```python
        code = ''.join(random.choice(self.chars) for i in range(6))
```
- Inside the `getCode` method, a random 6-character code is generated by selecting characters from the `chars` string using `random.choice`. The resulting characters are joined together to form a string.

```python
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + code
```
- The method returns the complete URL by appending the generated code to "http://tinyurl.com/".

```python
    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
```
- This line defines a method named `encode` within the `Codec` class. It takes a long URL (`longUrl`) as input and returns a string.

```python
        if longUrl in self.urlDB: return self.urlDB[longUrl]
```
- If the provided long URL is already in the `urlDB`, it immediately returns the corresponding short code from `urlDB`. This is a shortcut to avoid generating a new code if one already exists for the given long URL.

```python
        code = self.getCode()
```
- If the long URL is not in `urlDB`, a new code is generated using the `getCode` method.

```python
        while code in self.codeDB: code = getCode()
```
- A `while` loop is used to ensure that the generated code is unique. If the code already exists in `codeDB`, a new code is generated until a unique one is found.

```python
        self.codeDB[code] = longUrl
        self.urlDB[longUrl] = code
```
- Once a unique code is obtained, it is added to `codeDB` with the long URL as the value, and the mapping is also added to `urlDB`.

```python
        return code
```
- The method returns the generated code.

```python
    def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
```
- This line defines a method named `decode` within the `Codec` class. It takes a short URL (`shortUrl`) as input and returns a string.

```python
        return self.codeDB[shortUrl]
```
- The method directly returns the corresponding long URL by looking up the short code in `codeDB`.
