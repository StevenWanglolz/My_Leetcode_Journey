### *I failed to solve this problem in time*
# Approach
- Comprehend this question mathematically.
- For example, the number 82734:
1. Reduce 10111, you get 72623
2. Reduce 10101, you get 62622
3. Reduce 10100 * 4, you get 22222
4. Reduce 11111 * 2, you get 0
- You will realize that the number of times you need to reduce the number to reach 0, in this case 8, is equal to that of the largest digit of the number.
# Complexity
- Time complexity  
  
  The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the `max` function iterates over all the digits in the string, and the `map` function iterates over the string once to convert each digit to an integer.

Here is a table that summarizes the time complexity of the code:

| Operation          | Time Complexity |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| `max(map(int, n))` | O(n)            |
| Total              | O(n)            |
- Space complexity  
  The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the `dp` array stores the number of partitions for all subproblems up to the current number. The size of the `dp` array is therefore n + 1.

Here is a table that summarizes the space complexity of the code:

| Operation  | Space Complexity |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `dp` array | O(n)             |
| Total      | O(n)             |

# Code
```Python []
class Solution:
    def minPartitions(self, n: str) -> int:
        return max(map(int, n))
```
