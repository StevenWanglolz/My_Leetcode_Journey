We can optimize the space complexity of the vector `v`. Instead of storing entire strings, we can only store the characters at their corresponding indices. This would require O(n) space for the vector and the final `output` string, resulting in a total space complexity of O(n).

Here's how the code could be modified for optimized space:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string restoreString(string s, vector<int>& indices) {
        string output(s.size(), ' ');
        for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); ++i) {
            output[indices[i]] = s[i];
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```

This version iterates through the string just once and directly assigns characters to their correct positions in the `output` string, maintaining only one string in memory at a time.

Therefore, in summary, the space complexity of the original code can be reduced to O(n) with a slight modification, making it both time and space efficient.
