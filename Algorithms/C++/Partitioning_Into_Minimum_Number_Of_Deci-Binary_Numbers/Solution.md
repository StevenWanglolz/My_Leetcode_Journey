# Approach
- Comprehend this question mathematically.
- For example, the number 82734:
1. Reduce 10111, you get 72623
2. Reduce 10101, you get 62622
3. Reduce 10100 * 4, you get 22222
4. Reduce 11111 * 2, you get 0
- You will realize that the number of times you need to reduce the number to reach 0, in this case 8, is equal to that of the largest digit of the number.
# Complexity
- Time complexity  The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the `for` loop iterates over each character in the string, and the body of the loop takes constant time.

Here is a table that summarizes the time complexity of the code:

| Operation                      | Time Complexity |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Looping through the characters | O(n)            |
| Finding the maximum digit      | O(1)            |
| Returning the maximum digit    | O(1)            |
| Total                          | O(n)            |

- Space complexity  
The space complexity of the code is **O(1)**, independent of the input string length `n`.

Here's why:

1. **Primitive variable `num`:** This only stores a single integer value, regardless of the string length. Its space usage remains constant.
2. **Iterating over characters:** Each iteration uses constant space for temporary calculations and comparisons within the loop body.
3. **Finding the maximum digit:** This also involves constant space operations regardless of string length.

Therefore, the total space complexity is dominated by the constant space requirements of these operations and doesn't increase with the input size.
# Code
```C++ []
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string n) {
        int num = 0;
        for(auto c : n){
            int i = (c - '0');
            if(i >num){
                num = i;
            }
        }
        return num;
    }
};
